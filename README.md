# framework description:
trace the file/folder tree, being build(like setup.py ..you know?), such as temporary files being created and put into access allowed..
All other files and folders are not allowed: Permission denied. Also an evil hacker, sees on his screen "access denied", and a log on your own terminal shows you, that an evil hacker want access to your data.
That is mainly the story of practical access control.
# universal access control approach is not always suitable..
An suitable access control needs adjustments to the project. But iam searching for such an example, to demonstrate.
